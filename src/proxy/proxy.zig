//! The scope's proxy: the only way a confined command reaches a host by name.
//!
//! It runs outside the scope and listens on 127.0.0.1:<random>. The backend lets the command connect to that
//! port and nothing else, and the command gets HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and ALL_PROXY (and lowercase) pointing
//! at it (see `setEnv`).
//!
//! Two request forms:
//! - `CONNECT host:port`, for TLS only. After the tunnel opens, the first bytes the command sends must be a
//!   TLS ClientHello, and for a name its server name (SNI) must be present and equal the CONNECT host;
//!   otherwise the tunnel is closed before a byte reaches the upstream or comes back from it. This stops "CONNECT allowed.com"
//!   followed by "SNI evil.com" from reaching another site on a shared CDN address. A CONNECT to an IP
//!   literal (allowed only by a subnet) needs TLS but no particular server name.
//! - Plain HTTP with an absolute URI (`GET http://host/path`). The Host header is rewritten from the URI, so
//!   the request cannot name a different site, hop-by-hop headers are dropped, and the upstream connection
//!   carries exactly one request.
//!
//! Decision, in order:
//! 1. The destination port is checked with `Policy.checkPort`, before any name or DNS work. Grants never
//!    lift a port refusal.
//! 2. The host is normalized (lowercase, no trailing dot). An IP literal is decided by `Policy.checkLiteral`.
//! 3. A name is decided by `Policy.checkHost`; when the policy refuses it, an active grant may still allow it.
//! 4. An allowed name is resolved here, by the proxy, and every address is checked with
//!    `Policy.checkResolved`. Only addresses that pass are dialed. The command's own resolution is never used.
//!
//! Dialing (Happy Eyeballs, RFC 8305): the checked addresses alternate between IPv6 and IPv4, starting with
//! the family of the resolver's first answer. Each attempt starts `attempt_delay` after the previous one, or
//! as soon as the previous one fails, without waiting for it to give up; the first connection that opens is
//! used and the others are canceled. The whole dial has one `connect_timeout`. So an address whose packets
//! are dropped costs one `attempt_delay`, not a timeout. The CONNECT reply (200) is sent only once the
//! upstream connection is open.
//!
//! One receipt per decision (point "proxy"), event "connect" or "http". Besides the policy reason codes
//! (policy.Reason), the proxy uses:
//!   granted               allowed by an active grant (rule = the grant)
//!   bad_request           the request could not be parsed (400)
//!   resolve_failed        an allowed name did not resolve (502; rule = the allow entry)
//!   upstream_unreachable  no checked address accepted the connection within `connect_timeout` (502; rule =
//!                         the allow entry; detail = the last error, Timeout, or canceled when the scope ended
//!                         during the dial; wait_ms = time spent resolving and dialing)
//!   sni_mismatch          the TLS server name differs from the CONNECT host (tunnel closed)
//!   tls_unparsed          the first bytes were a TLS handshake that could not be parsed (tunnel closed)
//!   not_tls               the first bytes over CONNECT were not TLS (tunnel closed)
//!   sni_missing           a ClientHello for a name carried no server name (tunnel closed)
//!   grant_expired         a connection opened under a grant was reset when the grant expired
//!   grant_revoked         a connection opened under a grant was reset when the owner revoked it
//!   (Both sides are reset, not closed: bytes still queued toward the client or the upstream are dropped, so
//!   nothing moves through the proxy after the grant ends.)
//!   grant_watchdog_failed the task that enforces a grant's lifetime could not start (503)
//! A tunnel the client closes before sending a byte keeps its allow verdict and reason, with detail
//! client_closed (or canceled when the scope ended first) and wait_ms, the time the client waited for the 200.
//! Nothing reached the upstream. A client that gives up while the proxy is still dialing shows up this way.
//!
//! Declared limits (v0):
//! - Only the destination name and port are decided. Content inside TLS is not inspected: a request to an
//!   allowed host can carry any data to that host.
//! - Every process that can reach the port can use the proxy. A per-scope credential is a non-goal: each
//!   scope's backend lets it reach only its own proxy port, so another scope cannot use this one, and a
//!   process outside every scope already has direct network access, so a credential would stop nothing.
