        <p>
          {SITE.name} gives each task its own network permissions, decided by a policy file, and apps are next. Task
          scopes run natively on macOS (experimental) and Debian 13 (x86_64), headless, with no per-connection
          prompts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today it works for tasks. A coding agent runs commands on your machine: tests, installs, scripts. Each of
          those commands can connect anywhere your user can. {SITE.name} puts a network policy around a task before it
          starts. Every process the task spawns inherits that policy, and no process inside the task can grant itself
          more access.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same policy format will cover apps that are already on the machine, and a host ceiling will sit over
          everything. Nested scopes will only be able to narrow it.
        </p>

            Independence: check out v{RELEASE.version}, install Zig 0.17.0, run{' '}
            <code>zig build release -Dmacos-min=13.0</code>, and compare the hashes.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <H2>Linux helper</H2>
        <p>
          On Debian 13 x86_64, task scopes also need the helper, set up from a checkout of v{RELEASE.version}. You verify
          the release, build the helper, check its hash against <code>SHA256SUMS</code> and run the setup script with
          sudo, again after each reboot. The steps are in <a href={RELEASE.linuxSetup}>docs/linux.md</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The helper keeps four file capabilities (<code>CAP_CHOWN</code>, <code>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</code>,{' '}
          <code>CAP_NET_ADMIN</code> and <code>CAP_BPF</code>). Only root and the primary group of the user named at setup
          can run it, and <code>sudo ./scripts/linux-teardown.sh</code> removes it.
        </p>
        <H2>Other platforms</H2>
        <p>
          Intel Macs and Linux arm64 get a CLI build, but task scopes have not been shown on them. Linux arm64 has no
          helper yet, so scopes do not run there. Other Linux distributions are untested. On Ubuntu 24.04 and later,
          where <code>kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1</code> is the default, scopes are expected to fail
          closed.

          A command and every process it starts. {SITE.name} creates the scope and arms its policy before the command

        <H2>Addresses and DNS</H2>
        <p>
          A command inside a scope does not reach the network directly. It reaches only a local proxy outside the
          scope, which matches the host name against the policy and resolves allowed names itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every resolved address is checked again. Denied subnets always lose and allowed subnets win. Loopback,
          private, link-local, CGNAT and multicast addresses are refused unless an allowed subnet covers them, so an
          allowed name that resolves to 127.0.0.1 cannot reach local services. A destination written as an IP address
          is allowed only by an allowed subnet.
        </p>
        <H2>Ports</H2>
        <p>
          <code>ports</code> lists the destination ports a scope may reach. Without it, 80 and 443 are allowed. The port
          is checked first, before any name or DNS work, and a grant never lifts a port refusal.

        <H2>A strict file</H2>
        <p>
          Unknown fields are rejected, so a typo cannot widen a policy. If a backend cannot enforce something a policy

        <H2>Generations</H2>
        <p>
          The policy is loaded once, when the scope starts, and never read again from disk. Receipts name it by a short
          hash and a generation number. A policy change will commit as a new generation, all at once; if it fails, the
          previous generation will stay in force. In v0 the generation stays at 1: a grant does not change it.

          <strong>Tasks.</strong> Experimental. The command runs under the built-in sandbox (Seatbelt, started through{' '}

          connections except to the scope&apos;s local proxy and relay, and denies writes to {SITE.name}&apos;s state

          <strong>Apps.</strong> A Network Extension filter, written in Swift, will decide per app, by code-signing
          identity, and per destination, with the same policy format and receipts. It needs Apple&apos;s networking
          entitlement and a Developer ID signature to run, so until then its state can be at most{' '}

          <strong>Tasks.</strong> Each task gets a root-owned cgroup v2 before it executes. eBPF programs on that
          cgroup admit only TCP connections to the scope&apos;s local proxy; UDP and IPv6 have no allow path. Refusals
          go to a per-scope ring buffer and become receipts. Ring-buffer loss is counted and never allows traffic.

        <p>
          A small helper with file capabilities, never {SITE.name} itself, starts the command, holds it until the
          programs are attached, and only then lets it run. A private mount namespace hides resolver and daemon
          sockets and makes the state directory read-only. Seccomp and Landlock refuse raw sockets, filesystem and
          abstract Unix sockets, new namespaces and io_uring. Host nftables rules are not changed. The owner installs the helper with a short
          setup script run with sudo, once per boot. See{' '}

          fx and everything it starts in one task scope, with no changes to fx. This mode is not finished yet. In it,
          fx will reach its model through the relay that <code>{SITE.name} run --relay</code> starts outside the
          scope, so the model key never enters it. The relay is built and has no evidence entry yet.
        </p>
        <p>What the relay does not do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A tool inside the scope can still send any content to the allowed model endpoint through the relay. The
            relay keeps the key out of the scope, nothing more.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this first version the key is protected from the scope, not from other processes of the same user that
            run outside every scope.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <H2>Why use it with fx</H2>
        <p>
          In its default <code>auto</code> mode, fx runs recognized project commands such as tests, builds and local
          installs directly, and sends unfamiliar commands to a reviewer model (
          <a href="https://fx.sh/docs/configure-fx/permissions">fx permissions</a>). Since 0.0.5, approved commands run
          as ordinary host subprocesses (
          <a href="https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>). A network policy limits
          where any of those commands can connect, whatever approved them.

        <H2>Limits</H2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the per-command mode, fx starts no MCP servers, and its own network and MCP tools are blocked, not
            scoped.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the per-command mode, fx itself, its own file reads, its writes inside the workspace and its own
            connections, model traffic included, are outside every scope. What fx reads goes to the model&apos;s
            provider.

          <li>
            <strong>HTTP and TLS only, in v0.</strong> Allowed destinations are reached through the local proxy, so
            only HTTP and TLS over CONNECT can be allowed. Other protocols are refused.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clients only, in v0.</strong> Nothing inside a task scope can listen for connections, not even on
            loopback, on macOS or Linux. Dev servers and tests that open a port cannot run inside a scope, and a scoped
            command reaches no loopback port except its own proxy and relay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Same-user owner, in v0.</strong> Processes of the same user outside every scope count as the
            owner, and can reach the model relay&apos;s port.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not a prompt-injection detector.</strong> It blocks connections the policy does not allow. Data
            sent to an allowed destination is out of scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outside daemons.</strong> Work handed to a service outside the task (launchd, <code>open</code>,{' '}
            <code className="nb">systemd-run --user</code>, Docker, a tmux server) is refused only where a test shows
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared CDNs.</strong> An allowed name on a shared CDN can reach other sites on that CDN through
            domain fronting inside TLS: the proxy checks the TLS server name, not the encrypted request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local receipts.</strong> Receipts are a local record for diagnosis. Other programs of the same
            user, and administrators, can change them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inherited sockets.</strong> Sockets and file descriptors opened before the task, or passed in from
            outside, are not covered by its policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Same-user isolation.</strong> A network policy does not isolate a hostile process from files or
            other IPC owned by the same user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>macOS task scopes.</strong> They rely on <code>sandbox-exec</code>, which Apple marks as
            deprecated, so they stay experimental. App control on macOS needs a signed Network Extension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>macOS receipts.</strong> A kernel refusal gets a receipt only when macOS logs it, and it logs
            refusals of programs signed by Apple. An ad-hoc-signed program, such as one you built yourself, is refused
            the same way but leaves no receipt. Programs signed with a Developer ID were not tested. Under a burst some
            receipts are lost, and a process that outlives the command gets none.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Linux.</strong> Ping, SCTP and raw sockets are refused when they are created, so they leave no
            receipt. Only x86_64 was run.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Linux helper killed.</strong> If the helper is killed while a scope runs, processes that detached
            from the command keep running with access only to the dead proxy&apos;s local port, which another local
            program can later listen on; removing them needs root, and the receipts wrongly say the command did not
            start.
          </li>
