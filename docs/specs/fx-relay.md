# fx integration and relay

## What and why

[fx](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx) is a coding agent that runs commands on the machine: tests, builds,
installs. In its default auto mode, familiar project commands run with no review, so nobody has looked at the
code inside them. blackice works with fx in two ways. In the main mode, a small declared patch to fx's
`PreToolUse` hook runs every command fx launches in its own blackice scope, with its own policy and receipts,
while fx itself stays outside. In the fallback mode (L0), all of fx runs inside one scope without any change to
fx; then fx reaches its model through the relay, a small endpoint outside the scope that adds the key on the way
out, so the key never enters the scope.

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| fx-relay.R1 | blackice shall accept the gateway key only on standard input. It shall offer no flag, environment variable or file option for it, and the key shall not appear in the scope's environment, arguments, receipts or state directory. It shall refuse a key typed on a terminal, read the key only after the relay process is hardened (R2), and give the command `/dev/null` as its standard input when the relay is used. | P0-09 |
| fx-relay.R2 | When the relay starts, it shall harden its process before it reads the key: not dumpable on Linux (`PR_SET_DUMPABLE`), debugger attachment refused on macOS (`PT_DENY_ATTACH`), so that core dumps and same-user debuggers cannot read the key from its memory. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R3 | The relay shall listen only on `127.0.0.1` on a random port, and shall forward only `POST /v1/chat/completions` to the one configured gateway URL (`https`, or `http` only to loopback), adding the key; `GET /v1/models` is answered locally from the allow list. Any other method, path or target shall be refused with an error and a receipt. It shall also refuse a request that carries an `Origin` or any `Sec-Fetch-*` header, whose `Host` is not exactly `127.0.0.1:<port>`, or whose `Content-Type` is not `application/json`. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R4 | When a request names a model that is not on the scope's model allow list, the relay shall refuse it without contacting the gateway. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R5 | If a request body is larger than the size cap, or the scope has used its request cap, the relay shall refuse it without contacting the gateway. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R6 | The relay shall write one receipt per call with the scope, the model, the verdict, a reason code and the bytes sent and received. It shall never write prompt or response content or the key. | P0-09 |
| fx-relay.R7 | If a process in another task scope tries to connect to this scope's relay port, the operating system shall refuse the connection. | P0-02 |
| fx-relay.R8 | In L0 mode, when blackice prepares fx for a scope, it shall give fx its own home directory with a configuration that points one provider at `http://127.0.0.1:<relay port>/v1` with no authentication, using the file modes fx requires (directory `0700`, settings file `0600`). It shall not read or write the user's own fx configuration. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R9 | In L0 mode, when fx runs inside a task scope, fx and every process it starts shall reach the network only through the scope's proxy and relay. A direct connection from a tool to any other address shall be refused by the operating system, and fx shall still complete its run. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R10 | If the relay stops or the gateway cannot be reached, fx's model calls shall fail and the scope's policy shall stay in force: nothing falls back to a direct connection. | P0-06 |
| fx-relay.R11 | When the fx hook is installed and fx runs a command through its shell tool, the command shall run as `blackice run --policy <file> -- <command>`, in its own scope, with its own receipts. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R12 | When the hook starts a command, blackice shall give the scope a scrubbed environment, so secrets in fx's environment do not pass into the scope. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R13 | If the hook cannot start blackice, or blackice cannot create the scope, the command shall not run: the tool call fails instead of running unconfined. | P0-01 |
| fx-relay.R14 | blackice shall ship the hook as a declared patch under `integrations/fx/` that names the fx release tag and commit it applies to, so anyone can read exactly what it changes in fx. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R15 | The relay shall verify the gateway's TLS certificate and host name, and shall never follow a redirect to another host. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R16 | The relay shall refuse any request that does not carry its random per-relay token as `Authorization: Bearer`. `blackice run` shall give the token to the scope as `BLACKICE_RELAY_TOKEN`, and the L0 fx configuration shall send it from that variable. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R17 | When the fx hook is active, only a fixed list of fx tools shall run (`shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob_files`, `grep_files`, `ask_user_question`, `read_tool_result`, `skill`, `subagent`). Every other tool, including `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `install_skill`, MCP tools and tools added later, shall be blocked, and `fx acp` shall refuse to start. | P0-07 |
| fx-relay.R18 | If the hook cannot read a tool call safely (a request wrapper, a command that is not a string or contains a NUL byte, a shell other than `sh`, `bash` or `zsh`), it shall block the call. | P0-01 |
| fx-relay.R19 | When the hook rewrites a command, fx's outer shell shall start clean, without the user's startup files (`zsh -f`, `bash --noprofile --norc`); terminal sessions, shell reloads and a changed shell shall be blocked. | P0-01 |
| fx-relay.R20 | The hook shall require an absolute `FX_BLACKICE_BIN` equal to its real path, pin the policy's SHA-256 when fx starts, and run every command with `--policy-sha256`, `--protect <fx's own executable>` and a `--protect` for each of fx's profile files under `~/.fx` that exists when fx starts (`settings.json`, `mcp.json`, `auth.json`, `api-key`, and the provider sign-in files), so that blackice, the policy, fx and the next session's provider, model, credential and MCP servers stay unchanged for the next command. | P0-01 |
| fx-relay.R21 | When the fx hook is active, fx's `write_file` and `edit_file` shall accept only a relative path with no `..`, no leading `~`, and no NUL or backslash. If blackice, the policy or fx's own executable lies inside the workspace (the real path of fx's working directory), the hook shall block every call. | P0-01 |
| fx-relay.R22 | When the fx hook is active, fx shall start no MCP servers, from `~/.fx/mcp.json` or a project's `.mcp.json`: they would run outside every scope, and a scoped command can write a project's files. | P0-07 |

## Design

**Main mode: one scope per command.** The fx hook rewrites each shell tool call so the command runs under
`blackice run`. Each command gets a fresh scope, the policy file named in the hook's settings, a scrubbed
environment and its own receipts. fx and its model traffic stay outside every scope, so this mode needs no
relay. The patch is small, lives in the repo, and names the exact fx version it applies to; fx is Apache-2.0.

**Fallback mode: L0.** `blackice run --policy FILE -- fx` puts fx and everything it starts in one scope. fx's
model traffic then goes to the relay on a loopback port, and its commands reach the network only through the
proxy. The relay is deliberately narrow: one gateway, one API path, a list of models and two caps. It moves the
key out of the scope; it does not decide what content may be sent to the model.

**Technical.**

- Hook: a builtin `PreToolUse` handler added to fx by the patch in `integrations/fx/`. For the shell tool it
  rewrites the call to `blackice run --policy <file> -- <command>`. Other fx tools are not rewritten.
- Relay (`src/relay/`): sends upstream only `Content-Type`, `Accept-Encoding: identity`, `User-Agent` and its
  own `Authorization`; the caller's headers are dropped and redirects are not followed. It keeps its own copy of
  `Bearer <key>` and zeroes it on stop. Limits: exact-match model allow list, body size cap, call cap and
  connection cap; a request with a repeated `"model"` key, or with `n` other than 1, is refused. Only the 17
  standard top-level chat-completion fields pass; any other field, gateway routing options such as `providerOptions` or `models`
  included, is refused (`routing_not_allowed`), so a call cannot fall back to a model off the list.
  Each call is cut at a response size cap and a time limit, enforced by a watchdog; if the watchdog cannot
  start, the call is refused before anything goes upstream. Streamed answers (`stream: true`) pass
  through as they arrive. Receipts: `point: relay`, `event: relay_call`, with status, bytes in and out and
  whether it streamed in `detail`.
- Gateway (L0): an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint, such as AI Gateway. The relay reads the key from
  stdin once at start; on the demo machines it comes from a password manager and is piped straight in. Relay
  settings are `blackice run` flags.
- fx configuration (L0): a configured provider with protocol `openai-chat-completions`, `base_url` on loopback
  (fx accepts `http://` only for `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]` and `localhost`) and `auth: none`. fx ignores its user
  settings unless the private state directory is `0700` and `settings.json` is `0600`.
- Why a relay and not the proxy: fx's model client does not use proxy environment variables, so model
  traffic must reach a loopback endpoint directly.
- Tested target: fx v0.0.16. Every evidence entry names the fx release tag and commit used, and the mode.
- Limits:
  - Main mode: fx itself is not confined: its model traffic, its own reads and its writes inside the workspace run
    outside every scope. The hook confines the commands fx launches through its shell tool, keeps fx's own writes
    inside the workspace (R21), and blocks the tools not on its list, including its network tools (R17), and its
    MCP servers (R22). The P0-07 entry tried `web_fetch` only.
  - Main mode, fx's own permission modes: the hook runs before fx's permission check, so fx judges the
    rewritten `blackice run ...` command. In `auto` mode no rewritten command is on fx's short no-review list,
    so each one goes to fx's model reviewer. The reviewer sees the command text, the user's request and short
    excerpts of earlier tool output in the turn; it cannot read the files the command runs. If the reviewer is
    unavailable, fx refuses the command. In `full-access` mode nothing asks or reviews; the command still runs
    in its scope.
  - Main mode: fx starts no MCP servers and `fx acp` refuses to start (R17, R22). `cd` and
    `export` do not carry over between commands, since each runs in its own scope. Scopes are clients only.
  - Main mode: the hook is a patch, not an fx feature. Until fx offers a supported launch hook, each fx release
    needs the patch checked again.
  - L0: a tool inside the scope can call the relay too. It can send any content to the allowed model endpoint
    and use up the scope's caps. The caps limit the number of calls, the size of each answer and its time;
    they are not a budget in money. A demo with a real key needs its own budget set on the gateway key.
  - L0: the relay token (R16) keeps out processes that do not have it, and the header checks in R3 keep out web
    pages in the user's browser. The token is readable by everything in the scope, and by the user's other
    processes that can read the scope's environment (`/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux).
  - Main mode: fx's own file tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`) still run in fx, outside every scope. They are
    kept inside the workspace (R21), so blackice and fx must be installed outside it; root-owned is best.
  - Main mode: fx's reads are not limited, and what fx reads goes to the model provider; blackice limits only
    what scoped commands send.
  - Main mode: the hook keeps fx's provider credential out of each scope's environment (R12). A scoped command
    can still read a credential fx keeps in a file the user can read; whether it can read one fx keeps in the
    macOS keychain was not tested. blackice limits the network, not reads.
  - Main mode: only fx profile files that exist when fx starts are protected. A missing one, such as `api-key` or
    `auth.json`, can be created from a scope and is read by the next fx session. A new `~/.fx/mcp.json` has no
    effect in this mode (R22).
  - Earlier versions had five more gaps, fixed in 617882a, b88c52e and 08e34f3: the outer shell ran the user's
    startup files, the policy and binary could be changed from a scope, fx tools other than the shell were
    allowed, fx's file tools could write outside the workspace, and a scoped command could change fx's profile
    files or add an MCP server for the next session.
  - L0: one scope for fx and its tools, so no per-tool isolation; fx features that need other destinations fail
    unless the policy allows them.
  - The key is protected from the scope, not from other processes of the same user running outside every
    scope. Credential storage needs its own boundary.
  - Gateway features that differ between its native API and chat-completions may behave differently.

Each shell command got its own scope, with "4 protected files; policy pinned"; a variable from fx's environment was absent inside; writing `~/.fx/settings.json`, the policy, fx and blackice, and moving `bin/` or the policy, were all refused (`protected_path`), and the next command still got 403 under the pinned policy; hashes unchanged. `write_file` to an absolute path and `web_fetch` were blocked by the hook.

| fx-relay.R8, fx-relay.R9 | probe | - | Linux, 30 Oct: fx v0.0.16 in an empty network namespace with a scripted model on loopback and a stand-in proxy. No Authorization header reached the model; a direct request from a tool failed to resolve; the same request through the stand-in proxy arrived as CONNECT with the host name; fx exited 0. No blackice code. |
| fx-relay.R8, fx-relay.R9 | probe | - | macOS 27.0.1, 30 Oct, SIP off and then on: the same run under a Seatbelt profile allowing two loopback ports. Same results. No blackice code. |

| fx-relay.R6 | test | src/relay/test.zig: "an unreachable upstream gives 502 and a receipt", "end to end with the scripted model: tool calls stream through the relay" | Same run. The end-to-end test uses a scripted local model, not fx and not the gateway |
| fx-relay.R3, fx-relay.R4 | probe | - | Linux, 30 Oct, reported by the network owner in PR #4: relay to the real gateway with a synthetic key passed the gateway's 401 through with an allow receipt; a model off the list got 403 and a deny receipt. No real key |
| fx-relay.R11, fx-relay.R12, fx-relay.R13, fx-relay.R14, fx-relay.R18 | test | `integrations/fx/` (PR #9, 91885cb): 5 unit tests in the hook (quoting, run, interact and stop, blocked shapes, misconfiguration); the full fx build with the patch, natively and for aarch64-macos; the patch applies to a fresh v0.0.16 | Reported by the lead; not rerun by the spec session |
| fx-relay.R11, fx-relay.R12, fx-relay.R17 | probe | Reported by the lead: fx v0.0.16 (commit 481104fd) with the patch, macOS 27.0.1, SIP on, a scripted test model | Four commands ran in four scopes: example.com allowed with a receipt, github.com 403 with a receipt, a direct connection refused by the OS, a variable from fx's environment did not reach the commands.
