# macOS task scope (experimental)

## What and why

On macOS, `blackice run` starts the command inside the operating system's built-in sandbox. The sandbox lets the
command, and everything it starts, connect to exactly two places: blackice's own proxy and relay on this
machine. Every other connection fails inside the kernel, whether the program asks for a name, an IP address or
another local port. The proxy then decides which names are allowed, using the policy. This mode is
experimental: it uses a deprecated Apple tool, it covers commands that blackice starts, and it is not the app
control that a signed Network Extension will provide later (see [app-scopes](app-scopes.md)).

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| macos-task-scope.R1 | When `blackice run` starts a command on macOS, blackice shall apply the scope's sandbox profile before the command's first instruction, so the command never runs unconfined. | P0-01 |
| macos-task-scope.R2 | While a command runs in a macOS task scope, the kernel shall let it and every process it starts open outbound connections only to the scope's proxy and relay ports on loopback. Connections to any other address, including raw IP addresses and other loopback ports, shall fail. | P0-02 |
| macos-task-scope.R3 | While a command runs in a macOS task scope, a name lookup from inside the scope shall fail unless it is made by the proxy on the command's behalf. | P0-02 |
| macos-task-scope.R4 | When a process in the scope starts a child, including a child that outlives its parent and is adopted by launchd, the child shall keep the same restrictions. | P0-01, P0-02 |
| macos-task-scope.R5 | If the sandbox cannot be applied (sandbox-exec is missing, the profile is rejected, or the spawn fails), blackice shall not run the command, shall exit non-zero, and shall write a receipt with the reason. | P0-01 |
| macos-task-scope.R6 | blackice shall refuse attempts from inside the scope to have launchd, LaunchServices (`open`) or Apple Events (`osascript`) start a process outside the sandbox. | P0-02 |
| macos-task-scope.R7 | When blackice starts a command on macOS, the command shall not inherit any network socket from blackice. | P0-02 |
| macos-task-scope.R8 | blackice shall label this backend as experimental wherever it reports the backend: CLI help, the scope start receipt and the docs. | P0-10 |
| macos-task-scope.R9 | When the same policy and the same test destinations run in a macOS and a Linux task scope, blackice shall reach the same verdict for each destination. The receipts may differ only in the enforcement point. | P0-08 |
| macos-task-scope.R10 | A process inside a macOS task scope shall not be able to write the blackice state directory: receipts, the policy copy or the control socket. | P0-04 |
| macos-task-scope.R11 | A process inside a macOS task scope shall not be able to bind a socket or accept a connection on any address, loopback included: task scopes are clients only. | P0-02 |
| macos-task-scope.R12 | When the sandbox refuses something a process in the scope tried, blackice shall write a `kernel_drop` receipt with a reason (`loopback_proxy_only`, `clients_only`, `protected_path`, `launch_outside_scope`, or `seatbelt_refused` with the raw line when it cannot be parsed). If receipts are folded, lost or cannot be read, it shall say so in a `warning` receipt (`kernel_receipts_folded`, `kernel_receipts_lost`, `kernel_receipts_off`). | P0-02 |

## Design

blackice writes a short sandbox profile for each scope and starts the command through Apple's `sandbox-exec`
tool. The profile refuses all outbound network use and then allows the scope's two loopback ports. Because the
rule lives in the kernel and is inherited by every child, the command cannot step around it by ignoring proxy
settings: a program that does not use the proxy simply gets no network. The sandbox cannot name remote hosts
or addresses, only "any host" or "localhost", so every decision about names happens in the proxy.

**Technical.**

- Profile (`src/macos/seatbelt.zig`), for proxy port 18780 and relay port 18781:

  ```scheme
  (version 1)
  (allow default)
  (deny network-outbound)
  (allow network-outbound (remote ip "localhost:18780"))
  (allow network-outbound (remote ip "localhost:18781"))
  ```

  Then, always: `(deny network-bind)`, `(deny network-inbound)` (R11),
  `(deny file-write* (subpath (param "STATE_ROOT")))` (R10), `(deny job-creation)`, `(deny lsopen)` and
  `(deny appleevent-send)` (R6). `STATE_ROOT` is the real path of the blackice state root, passed with
  `sandbox-exec -D STATE_ROOT=<path>`.
- Why no loopback listeners: Seatbelt cannot limit a listener to loopback. An allow for `local ip
  "localhost:*"` also admitted `0.0.0.0` and connections from the local network, so the profile refuses every
  bind, as the Linux backend does.
- Launch: `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -p <profile> <command...>` with the environment the core prepared
  (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` and lowercase forms point at the proxy). The backend contract is
  `src/core/backend.zig` (`LaunchSpec`, `launch`).
- `(deny network-outbound)` also covers Unix-socket connections. That blocks the system DNS resolver socket
  (mDNSResponder) and is expected to keep the scope away from blackice's own control socket (see
  [grant](grant.md)); the second point still needs its own test.
- `(allow default)` means files, processes and other IPC are not restricted, except the state directory. This
  is a network boundary only.
- `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple but still ships and still applies profiles. This backend stays
  experimental for that reason and because it covers only commands blackice starts.
- Limits until tested:
  - Mach and XPC services: a process can still ask a system service to connect on its behalf. Such
    connections run outside the scope.
  - Processes started through `open` or `osascript`: the deny rules are in the profile, but their tests open
    windows and have not run yet.
  - No command inside a scope can run a local server, even on loopback.
  - Name lookups through other system services (for example Directory Services) are untested.
  - The proxy port: what happens if the proxy restarts or another local process takes its port, and how one
    scope's proxy is kept from serving another, belong to [proxy](proxy.md) and are untested.
  - Inherited sockets (R7) are untested.
  - Sandbox refusals reach the receipts by reading the kernel log (`log stream`, filtered to the scope's tag).
    Other processes of the same user can tag their own profiles, so receipts can be added to but not removed;
    bursts lose lines in the kernel log (239 of 300 in a tight loop), and repeats of one refusal are folded
    and counted. In the P0-04 run, the refused connect to the control socket left no receipt; whether the
    kernel log omits it or the reader misses it is being checked.
  - The state root's parent directories are also denied rename, hard links to files in the state root are refused,
    and the root is checked by its real path. An earlier build let a command rename a parent and then write
    its own receipts.

| Covers | Kind | Link | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| macos-task-scope.R2, macos-task-scope.R6, macos-task-scope.R10, macos-task-scope.R11 | test | `zig build test`, src/macos/seatbelt.zig: "profile" | 21/21 passed at 99e2f4e (PR #1), Zig 0.17.0, Linux x86_64. Checks the profile text only, not enforcement |
| macos-task-scope.R6, macos-task-scope.R10, macos-task-scope.R11 | probe | Reported by the lead: the exact profile on macOS 27.0.1, SIP on | Binds and listeners refused (8 address variants), writes under `STATE_ROOT` refused, launchd job creation refused; `git`, `swift` and fx still ran. `open` and `osascript` not exercised. No evidence entry yet |
| macos-task-scope.R2 | probe | Sandbox probe on macOS 27.0.1 (26A434), Apple M4, SIP on, without blackice code | With only localhost allowed, a connection to a raw IP failed at once; with one loopback port allowed, another loopback port was blocked; a stand-in proxy on the allowed port received `CONNECT example.com:443` |
| macos-task-scope.R3 | probe | Same probe | With all outbound network denied, `curl https://example.com` failed with "Could not resolve host" |
| macos-task-scope.R4 | probe | Same probe | A background child, orphaned and adopted by launchd (parent PID 1), was still blocked |
| macos-task-scope.R2 | probe | fx 0.0.16 inside the same kind of profile, scripted local model, stand-in proxy, SIP on | fx reached its model only on the allowed port; a direct `curl` from a tool could not resolve the host; through the stand-in proxy the request arrived as `CONNECT example.com:443` |
| macos-task-scope.R1, macos-task-scope.R2, macos-task-scope.R10 | probe | Reported by the lead: `blackice run` (PR #7, 61ffe84) on macOS 27.0.1 (26A434), arm64, SIP on, ReleaseSafe | `curl --noproxy '*'` to a name failed (exit 6) and to 1.1.1.1 failed (exit 7); 169.254.169.254 through the proxy got `local_or_private_address`; writing the receipts from inside was refused, and so were a parent rename and a hard link to the home directory, /private/tmp or an ancestor (security re-check of 7e26dfd: no open findings). No evidence entry yet |
