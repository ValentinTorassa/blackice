# Linux app-filter demo preparation

These policies and commands are preparation, not passing evidence. The service, BPF programs and installation
still need security clearance and the owner's approval. Do not start an app-filter runtime test while that gate
is closed. The current binary has only been built and tested in userspace.

Offline checks for these fixtures:

```sh
zig test src/linux_appfilter_demo_test.zig --test-filter 'appfilter demo'
python3 -I tools/test_linux_appfilter_probe.py
```

These parse policy files and exercise mocked socket failures. They do not execute the network, fork, service
or installation paths.

## Three applications

[`linux-apps-demo.json`](../examples/linux-apps-demo.json) lists actual executable files, not launch scripts,
desktop names, `argv[0]` or `comm`. These canonical root-owned files were found on the target Debian host by
read-only inspection; repeat that inspection after package updates. Close listed applications before arming.

| ID | Executable | Allowed HTTP(S) names | Example refusal |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr` | `example.com`, `example.org` | `github.com`, `incoming.telemetry.mozilla.org` |
| 2 | `/usr/bin/wget` | `example.org` | `example.com` |
| 3 | `/usr/bin/curl` | `example.com` | `example.org` |

Use a new empty Firefox profile, without accounts, browsing history or extensions. The few allowed names are
deliberate: this is a small demonstration, not a usable general browsing policy. Other page dependencies,
updates, authentication services and CDNs may be refused. Allowlisting a name is not a guarantee that its
server, DNS or certificate is available.

Firefox's telemetry name is outside its allowlist; the current policy format has no domain-deny exceptions.
Mozilla identifies `incoming.telemetry.mozilla.org` as a telemetry endpoint in its
[source documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/data/install-ping.html).
A manual navigation to that name proves a name-based refusal only if the corresponding receipt is present.
Label it **“manual request to a telemetry endpoint”**. It does not prove that Firefox attempted an automatic
telemetry upload, or that all telemetry is blocked. Do not turn on data collection or manufacture a telemetry
payload for the demo. If no automatic request is observed, record that result. Telemetry behavior varies by
build and settings; Mozilla documents those [controls](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/internals/preferences.html).

For the short take: show curl reaching `example.com` and refusing `example.org`, then wget reaching
`example.org` and refusing `example.com`. Open the fresh Firefox profile on an allowed page, navigate to a
refused name, and show actual `app_filter` receipts with different `app_id` and `executable` fields. Do not use
`blackice run`, explicit proxy variables or an existing browser instance for this shot: the intended claim is
automatic classification of a newly executed listed file, independent of a task scope.

## What identity evidence can establish

| Change | Intended behavior; confirm in the installed run |
|---|---|
| Change `argv[0]`, `comm`, desktop entry or path spelling | Does not change the executable inode used for classification. |
| Rename the same listed file or use a hard link to its inode | Device and inode stay the same, so identity stays the same. Do not rename system binaries for the demo. |
| Fork, double-fork or exec a different executable from a tagged process | The first listed identity persists in descendants, even through a UID change. |
| Copy a listed binary to a new inode and launch it from an unlisted process | The copy is unlisted. This is a coverage limit, not publisher/code-signing identity. |
| Execute that copy from an already tagged parent | Inherits the parent's restriction; copying does not clear an existing tag. |
| Root replaces a package file with a new inode | Inotify adds it; the interval before refresh, especially during service downtime, is not covered. |

No blanket “renaming or copying cannot bypass it” claim is supported. New tags use the configured owner's real
UID. A listed application can delegate work through unlisted helpers, portals, D-Bus or received sockets; see
the [full limits](linux-appfilter.md#limits-to-review-before-installation).

## Evidence fixture

[`linux-apps-evidence.json`](../examples/linux-apps-evidence.json) temporarily substitutes `/usr/bin/setsid`
for Firefox. A fresh `setsid --fork --wait python3 -I ...` should retain app ID 1 through exec and descendants,
without listing the system Python interpreter and restricting unrelated Python processes. This policy affects
every new invocation of that setsid executable by the configured owner while active; keep this phase brief
and isolated from other work. Switch policies only through authorized `app off`, then a fresh `app on`.

[`linux-appfilter-probe.py`](../scripts/e2e/linux-appfilter-probe.py) prepares synthetic TCP/UDP IPv4/IPv6,
mapped-IPv6, protocol-creation and double-fork checks. It requires an explicit runtime-test flag. Its network
and fork paths have not been executed during preparation. Error codes alone are insufficient: correlate them
with kernel receipts and before/after controls at a separate receiver. The receiver logs no peer addresses.

Arming-phase recovery has only a userspace model test. The security gate still requires real crash/restart,
kill-then-fork and kill-at-each-arming-phase checks; this demo preparation does not mark them passed.
